# Elite Options System v2.5 - Project Brief
## ðŸ§  KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FOUNDATION #1

**FOUNDATIONAL INTELLIGENCE**: The Persistent Knowledge Graph MCP serves as the central intelligence hub and primary authority for all project decisions, patterns, and system evolution.

## Project Name
Elite Options System v2.5

## Purpose
A cutting-edge, adaptive, and modular Elite Options Trading System (EOTS) designed for sophisticated options market analysis, focusing initially on SPX and similar underlyings. The Apex EOTS provides unparalleled trading intelligence through advanced data ingestion, adaptive analytics, dynamic signal generation, and intelligent trade idea formulation, all orchestrated for perpetual self-improvement and market dominion.

## Core Goals
- Ingest, process, and sanctify options chain and underlying data from diverse sources (ConvexValue, Tradier).
- Forge a comprehensive Apex Metric Arsenal (Tier 1, 2, and 3) for deep market insights.
- Dynamically classify market regimes and identify critical Key Levels.
- Generate continuously scored, context-modulated trading signals.
- Synthesize intelligence into high-conviction, actionable trade ideas via the Adaptive Trade Idea Framework (ATIF).
- Optimize trade parameters (contracts, entry, stop-loss, profit targets) for precise execution.
- Orchestrate the entire analytical and recommendation lifecycle with the ITSOrchestratorApexV1.
- Provide an interactive, real-time Dashboard (Obsidian Mirror) for comprehensive visualization and operator control.
- Implement a robust Phoenix Cycle of performance tracking and adaptive learning for continuous self-improvement.
- Ensure system configurability and adaptability through `config_apex_v1.json` and `symbol_specific_overrides`.

## Scope - Knowledge Graph Authority
